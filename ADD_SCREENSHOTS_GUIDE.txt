HOW TO ADD APP SCREENSHOTS TO WEBSITE
======================================

The website is now configured to display your app screenshots. Follow these steps:

STEP 1: SAVE THE SCREENSHOTS
-----------------------------
1. Save the first screenshot (showing counter "4" with beads) as:
   website/images/screenshot1.png

2. Save the second screenshot (showing "Choose Mantra" modal) as:
   website/images/screenshot2.png

3. Save the third screenshot (showing "Settings" screen) as:
   website/images/screenshot3.png

STEP 2: UPLOAD TO YOUR WEB SERVER
----------------------------------
When you deploy your website, make sure to upload the images folder:
- website/images/screenshot1.png
- website/images/screenshot2.png
- website/images/screenshot3.png

STEP 3: VERIFY
--------------
After uploading, visit your website and you should see:
- A new "App Preview" section below the Features
- Three screenshots displayed in a responsive grid
- 3 columns on desktop, stacks vertically on mobile
- Hover effects on the screenshot cards
- Clean open-source Lucide icons (no emojis)

OPTIONAL: ADD MORE SCREENSHOTS
-------------------------------
To add more screenshots, simply:
1. Add more images to website/images/
2. Add more screenshot-card divs in index.html following this pattern:

<div class="screenshot-card">
    <img src="images/screenshot3.png" alt="Description" loading="lazy">
    <p>Caption text here</p>
</div>

The grid will automatically adjust to fit the new screenshots!
