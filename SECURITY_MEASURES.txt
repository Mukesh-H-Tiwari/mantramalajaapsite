WAITLIST SECURITY MEASURES
==========================

This document outlines all security measures implemented to protect user emails and data.

OVERVIEW
--------
The waitlist system collects only email addresses and timestamps. All data is stored securely 
in Google Sheets with multiple layers of protection.

CLIENT-SIDE SECURITY (Website)
-------------------------------

1. EMAIL VALIDATION
   ✅ Comprehensive regex pattern validation
   ✅ Length checks (max 254 characters)
   ✅ Format validation (no consecutive dots, proper @ placement)
   ✅ Character filtering (blocks <, >, ", ')
   ✅ HTML5 pattern attribute for browser-level validation
   ✅ Normalization to lowercase

2. INPUT SANITIZATION
   ✅ Trim whitespace
   ✅ Remove dangerous characters
   ✅ Prevent script injection attempts
   ✅ Maxlength attribute on input field

3. RATE LIMITING
   ✅ Button disabled during submission
   ✅ 60-second cooldown after successful submission
   ✅ Prevents rapid-fire submissions

4. REQUEST SECURITY
   ✅ 10-second timeout on fetch requests
   ✅ Abort controller for timeout handling
   ✅ HTTPS-only communication
   ✅ Error handling for network issues

5. USER PRIVACY
   ✅ Privacy notice displayed on form
   ✅ Link to full privacy policy
   ✅ Consent statement
   ✅ Clear data usage explanation

SERVER-SIDE SECURITY (Google Apps Script)
------------------------------------------

1. EMAIL VALIDATION
   ✅ Server-side regex validation
   ✅ Length validation (max 254 chars)
   ✅ Format checks (no consecutive dots, etc.)
   ✅ Type checking (must be string)
   ✅ Cannot be bypassed by client manipulation

2. DUPLICATE PREVENTION
   ✅ Checks existing emails before adding
   ✅ Case-insensitive comparison
   ✅ Prevents spam and duplicate entries
   ✅ Returns user-friendly error message

3. RATE LIMITING
   ✅ Maximum 10 submissions per minute globally
   ✅ Timestamp-based tracking
   ✅ Prevents DoS attacks
   ✅ Automatic cooldown period

4. INPUT SANITIZATION
   ✅ Removes HTML/script tags
   ✅ Strips dangerous characters (<, >, ", ')
   ✅ Trims whitespace
   ✅ Enforces length limits
   ✅ Converts to lowercase

5. ERROR HANDLING
   ✅ Try-catch blocks for all operations
   ✅ Detailed logging for debugging
   ✅ Generic error messages to users (no sensitive info)
   ✅ Graceful failure handling

6. ACCESS CONTROL
   ✅ Script runs with owner's permissions
   ✅ Sheet access restricted to specific users
   ✅ Viewer-only permissions for collaborators
   ✅ No public edit access

DATA STORAGE SECURITY
----------------------

1. GOOGLE SHEETS PROTECTION

3. DATA MINIMIZATION
   ✅ Only collect necessary data (email + timestamp)
   ✅ No sensitive personal information
   ✅ No tracking cookies
   ✅ No IP address logging (optional)
   ✅ No user agent logging (optional)

4. DATA RETENTION
   ✅ Clear purpose for data collection
   ✅ Data used only for launch notifications
   ✅ Can be deleted upon request
   ✅ Regular backups recommended
   ✅ Archive old data when needed

COMPLIANCE & PRIVACY
---------------------

1. GDPR COMPLIANCE
   ✅ Explicit consent obtained
   ✅ Clear privacy notice
   ✅ Right to access data
   ✅ Right to deletion
   ✅ Data minimization
   ✅ Purpose limitation
   ✅ No third-party sharing

2. PRIVACY POLICY
   ✅ Comprehensive privacy policy available
   ✅ Linked from waitlist form
   ✅ Explains data usage clearly
   ✅ Contact information provided
   ✅ Updated regularly

3. USER RIGHTS
   ✅ Right to know what data is collected
   ✅ Right to access their data
   ✅ Right to delete their data
   ✅ Right to opt-out
   ✅ Right to data portability

MONITORING & MAINTENANCE
-------------------------

1. REGULAR CHECKS
   □ Review execution logs weekly

   □ Update validation rules as needed
   □ Review and improve security regularly

SECURITY BEST PRACTICES
------------------------

1. FOR ADMINISTRATORS
   ✅ Enable 2FA on Google account
   ✅ Use strong, unique password
   ✅ Don't share script URL publicly
   ✅ Review access permissions regularly
   ✅ Keep backup of data
   ✅ Monitor execution logs
   ✅ Rotate deployment if compromised

2. FOR USERS
   ✅ Use valid email address
   ✅ Read privacy policy
